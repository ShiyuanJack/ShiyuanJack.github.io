Background
======
Mr. Xu is a Ph.D. student, supervised by [Prof. Yiu, Siu Ming](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/smyiu), in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Hong Kong. Before he came to Hong Kong, he received the B.Eng. degree majoring in information security at North China University of Technology. He was an online research assistant with [Dr. Gao Shang](https://goldsainteagle.github.io/shanggao.github.io/) at the The Hong Kong Polytechnic University within half year and interned as a summer research assiatant with [Dr. Ramanathan, Ravishankar](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/ravi) at The University of Hong Kong in 2021. During his bachelor's study, he has published several academic conference and journal papers.

Research Interests
======
Broadly speaking, I am interested in information security and applied cryptography. Specifically, my current research mainly focus on signature protocols, post-quantum cryptography, searchable encryption, security in Internet of Things(such as VANET architecture, EMR data, etc.) and also blockchain security.
