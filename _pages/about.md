Background
======
Mr. Xu is currently a Ph.D. student, supervised by [Prof. Yiu Siu-Ming](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/smyiu), in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Hong Kong. Before he came to Hong Kong, he received a B.Eng. degree majoring in information security. He interned as a summer research assistant with [Dr. Ramanathan Ravishankar](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/ravi) at The University of Hong Kong in 2021. 

Research Interests
======
Broadly speaking, I am interested in Applied Cryptography and Information Security. Specifically, my current research mainly focuses on Post-Quantum Cryptography, Public Key Encryption, Signature Protocols, and Privacy-Preserving in the Internet of Things (e.g. VANET, EMR data).
