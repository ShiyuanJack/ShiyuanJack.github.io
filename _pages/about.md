Background
======
Mr. Xu is an undergraduate student in North China University of Technology. He is studying B.Eng. in information security with expected graduate in 2022. After graduation, he will pursue Ph.D degree in the future.  He was a research assistant with [Dr. Gao Shang](https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/en-us/staffs/detail/7904) at the The Hong Kong Polytechnic University within two months and interned as a summer research assiatant with [Dr. Ramanathan, Ravishankar](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/ravi) at The University of Hong Kong in 2021. During his bachelor's study, he has published many academic conference and journal papers.

Research Interests
======
Broadly speaking, I am interested in information security and applied cryptography. Specifically, my current research mainly focus on signature protocols, post-quantum cryptography, security and privacy in Internet of Things(such as VANET architecture, EMR data, etc.) and also blockchain security.
