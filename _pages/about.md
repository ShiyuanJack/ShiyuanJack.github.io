Background
======
Mr. Xu is currently a Ph.D. student, supervised by [Prof. Yiu Siu-Ming](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/smyiu), in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Hong Kong. Before he came to Hong Kong, he received the B.Eng. degree majoring in information security. He was an online research assistant with [Dr. Gao Shang](https://goldsainteagle.github.io/shanggao.github.io/) at the The Hong Kong Polytechnic University within half year and interned as a summer research assiatant with [Dr. Ramanathan Ravishankar](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/ravi) at The University of Hong Kong in 2021. 

Research Interests
======
Broadly speaking, I am interested in information security and applied cryptography. Specifically, my current research mainly focus on post-quantum cryptography, encryption algorithms, signature protocols, privacy-preserving in Internet of Things(such as VANET, EMR data, etc.) and also blockchain security.
